Caches:

	On Reset:
		set Flags wait for mem write/read to Zero
		Set all valid bits to invalid
		Set read_data to None
	On Cache Miss:
		Think what difference in clock cycle between two situations:
		1. Data is Hit
		2. Data is available after Data Miss
		3. Do we need to save previous state somewhere?(check line no 127). If on cache miss/stalling, we are letting the previous stage complete then we will have to save it otherwise the inputs will change.
		previous stage,
